Understanding the problem
The console error POST https://cracker-base-mnews4bky-lumbas-projects-e0389f01.vercel.app/api/auth/verify-pin 404 (Not Found) indicates that the server could not find a resource matching the requested URL and HTTP method. Specifically, your application made a POST request to the /api/auth/verify-pin endpoint on your Vercel deployment, but the server responded with a 404 status code, meaning "Not Found".

This typically happens when:

The URL is incorrect.
The backend route for /api/auth/verify-pin using the POST method is not implemented or incorrectly configured on your Vercel deployment.
Based on the provided information, the code correctly uses the POST method and the intended path /api/auth/verify-pin. The issue is likely on the server side, where the route is not correctly defined or deployed.

How to verify
You can verify this by:

Checking your serverless function or API route code: Ensure you have a file or function handling POST requests to /api/auth/verify-pin in your backend code.
Reviewing your Vercel deployment logs: Look for errors during the build or deployment process on Vercel that might indicate issues with your API routes.
Testing the endpoint directly: Use a tool like Postman or curl to make a POST request to https://cracker-base-mnews4bky-lumbas-projects-e0389f01.vercel.app/api/auth/verify-pin with a JSON body containing a pin. A 404 response will confirm the endpoint is not found.
Suggested fix
The fix involves ensuring that the backend route /api/auth/verify-pin is correctly implemented and deployed to Vercel. This might involve:

Creating the API route: If the route doesn't exist, create a file (e.g., pages/api/auth/verify-pin.js or app/api/auth/verify-pin/route.js depending on your framework and version) that handles POST requests to this path.
Correcting the existing API route: If the route exists, double-check the file name, location, and the code within it to ensure it correctly handles POST requests and is free of syntax errors that might prevent it from being deployed correctly.
Ensuring the route is included in your deployment: Verify that the file containing your API route is included in the files being deployed to Vercel.
Without knowing the specifics of your backend framework (e.g., Next.js Pages Router, App Router, Express, etc.), a concrete code example is difficult. However, the general idea is to have a server-side handler for the POST request at the /api/auth/verify-pin path.

For example, if you are using Next.js App Router, you would create a file at app/api/auth/verify-pin/route.js with content similar to this:

js

// app/api/auth/verify-pin/route.js

import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function POST(request) {
  try {
    const { pin } = await request.json();

    // Implement your PIN verification logic here
    // For example:
    const isPinValid = pin === process.env.EXPECTED_PIN; // Use environment variables for sensitive data

    if (isPinValid) {
      return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
    } else {
      return NextResponse.json({ success: false }, { status: 401 }); // Unauthorized
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('PIN verification error:', error);
    return NextResponse.json({ success: false, error: 'Internal Server Error' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
Use code snippets with caution

After implementing or correcting the backend route, redeploy your application to Vercel.

Summary
The 404 error for the POST request to /api/auth/verify-pin means the server could not find the requested resource. The solution is to ensure that the backend route for this specific path and HTTP method is correctly implemented and deployed on your server (in this case, on Vercel).
